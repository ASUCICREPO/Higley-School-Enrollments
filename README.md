# Higley

## Project Overview

The Higley Unified School District, one of Arizona's fastest growing school districts, with modest continued growth is a consortium of 16 schools that serve the areas of Gilbert and Queen Creek with more than 13000 students.

Predicting school enrollment is crucial for Higley when planning for a new school year:
- Plan for resources 
- Hire new teachers
- Build Infrastructure

If actual enrollments are lesser than projected enrollments 
- Over budgeting
- Wasted resources, Small class size, Layoffs, etc. 

If actual enrollments are greater than projected enrollments
- Under budgeting
- Not enough resources, Overcrowded class size, etc.
