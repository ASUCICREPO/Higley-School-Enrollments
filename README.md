## Project Overview

The Higley Unified School District, one of Arizona's fastest growing school districts, with modest continued growth is a consortium of 16 schools that serve the areas of Gilbert and Queen Creek with more than 13000 students.

Predicting school enrollment is crucial for Higley when planning for a new school year:
- Plan for resources 
- Hire new teachers
- Build Infrastructure

If actual enrollments are lesser than projected enrollments 
- Over budgeting
- Wasted resources, Small class size, Layoffs, etc. 

If actual enrollments are greater than projected enrollments
- Under budgeting
- Not enough resources, Overcrowded class size, etc.

## Description
The Higley Unified School District, a rapidly growing educational institution in Arizona, comprises a consortium of 16 schools catering to the Gilbert and Queen Creek areas. With an expanding student population of over 13,000, accurately predicting school enrollments becomes paramount for effective planning and resource allocation for each new academic year.

Accurate enrollment prediction enables the district to proactively plan for essential resources, such as hiring new teachers and developing adequate infrastructure. By anticipating student numbers, Higley can avoid the negative consequences associated with deviations between projected and actual enrollments. Higley previously collaborated with a vendor who provided static enrollment predictions using Excel, resulting in an accuracy rate of only 80%. These predictions were limited to one-time use, necessitating the procurement of fresh predictions each year. Consequently, this approach incurred additional costs of approximately $20,000. Moreover, the inability to update or adjust predictions based on changing circumstances imposed significant constraints on the district's operational flexibility.

In instances where actual enrollments fall below projected numbers, overbudgeting occurs, leading to wasted resources and inefficient allocation of funds. The repercussions include maintaining small class sizes, which may not be cost-effective, and potential layoffs due to surplus staff. Conversely, when actual enrollments surpass projected figures, underbudgeting becomes a concern. The district may face a shortage of resources, resulting in overcrowded classrooms and compromised educational experiences for students.

To address the limitations posed by the previous vendor's static predictions and enhance their ability to forecast enrollment accurately, Higley Unified School District seeks an advanced solution that offers flexibility, higher accuracy, and the capacity for iterative predictions. By doing so, Higley aims to optimize resource allocation, avoid unnecessary expenses, and ensure an optimal learning environment for its students.

## Solution Outcome
The Arizona State University Cloud Innovation Center has developed a cutting-edge machine learning-based prediction engine that surpasses customer expectations by delivering an accuracy rate exceeding 90% with a deviation of less than 2% (customer requirement was a deviation less than 10%). The cost of implementing this solution is estimated to be approximately $50 per month.

The solution includes a state-of-the-art web portal that allows users to effortlessly upload data and view prediction results in a user-friendly interface. With this advanced system in place, Higley Unified School District gains the ability to generate up-to-date predictions dynamically, ensuring the accuracy and relevance of forecasted enrollment figures.

By leveraging this state-of-the-art solution, Higley Unified School District can effectively optimize their budget and resource allocation while ensuring an optimal learning environment for their students. The affordable cost of $50 per month makes this solution both accessible and cost-effective, providing Higley with a valuable tool for strategic decision-making and efficient management of their educational system.
